You must answer at least 4 questions, but the remaining ones are optional. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: The staff solution created the wrapIndex method to avoid redundant codes, while my previous solution used negative index judgement multiple times.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: 

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I used "System.arraycopy" instead of for loop to resize array so that it was really hard to debug.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: 

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A:

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would use for loop instead of arraycopy method to resize the array and use get method to get items in it.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: The recursive method the staff demonstrates are much clearer than my solution. I created Node both in getRecursive and its helper method and it was hard to debug, while in TA's solution Node is created once.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A:

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A:

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: Thinking about how constructor build is important for the beginning of a project.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: 

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?
